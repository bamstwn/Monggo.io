## Running Test

To run the test, set [Firestore Rule](https://console.firebase.google.com/u/0/project/monggo-io/database/firestore/rules) from this:

```
rules_version = '2';
service cloud.firestore {
  match /databases/{database}/documents {
    match /{document=**} {
      allow read, write: if request.auth != null;
    }
  }
}
```

to this:

```
rules_version = '2';
service cloud.firestore {
  match /databases/{database}/documents {
    match /{document=**} {
      allow read, write;
    }
  }
}
```

And the [Storage Rule](https://console.firebase.google.com/u/0/project/monggo-io/storage/monggo-io.appspot.com/rules) from this:

```
rules_version = '2';
service firebase.storage {
  match /b/{bucket}/o {

      allow read, write: if request.auth != null;
    }
  }
}
```

```
rules_version = '2';
service firebase.storage {
  match /b/{bucket}/o {
