## Running Test

To run the test, set [Firestore Rule](https://console.firebase.google.com/u/0/project/monggo-io/database/firestore/rules) from this:

```
rules_version = '2';
service cloud.firestore {
  match /databases/{database}/documents {
    match /{document=**} {
      allow read;
      allow write: if request.auth != null;
    }
  }
}
```

to this:

```
rules_version = '2';
service cloud.firestore {
  match /databases/{database}/documents {
    match /{document=**} {
      allow read, write;
    }
  }
}
```

And the [Storage Rule](https://console.firebase.google.com/u/0/project/monggo-io/storage/monggo-io.appspot.com/rules) from this:

```
rules_version = '2';
service firebase.storage {
  match /b/{bucket}/o {
    match /{allPaths=**} {
      allow read, write: if request.auth != null;
    }
  }
}
```

to this:

```
rules_version = '2';
service firebase.storage {
  match /b/{bucket}/o {
    match /{allPaths=**} {
      allow read, write;
    }
  }
}

```

Both of them allow client side to run the test without any of permissions.

After that, open `store/user.js` file and read the direction start from line 10. Then open `layouts/admin.vue` and read the direction start from line 233.

To run the test, execute this command below:

```bash
$ yarn test:e2e
```
